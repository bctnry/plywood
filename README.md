# plywood

for some reasons i need to write a lexer of python 3 and i thought why not just implement the whole thing as well so here i am, doing all the dirty works and...

oh. hi.

## how much you're gonna do, then?

plywood is planned to be a pythoon-to-js compiler, so some modules that come with the CPython distribution should be expected to not exist in plywood.

## why the name `plywood`?

it goes like this: `Python -> py -> pry -> ply -> plywood`.
